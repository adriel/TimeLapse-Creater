## Render timelapse script

Basically, this script will take all your .jpg images in a folder and spit out a .mp4 x264 video file into the same folder at the same resolution as the source .jpg files.

##Features

- Works with 4K jpg source
- Will combine images in oldest to newest date (as sometimes when you export the filename wont be in a-z order)
- Exported video always has a unique filename


###Note
This script was built for use on a Mac, so there may be bugs when running on a Linux distro.
